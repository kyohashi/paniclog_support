## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

### Basic Usage

#### Q: How do I use PanicLog?
**A**: PanicLog has four main functions:
- **Recording Function**: Record anxiety attacks in real-time, including duration, intensity, coping methods, and other details
- **Analysis Function**: View recorded data in calendar format and statistical graphs to analyze patterns
- **Support Function**: Access breathing guides and encouraging messages during attacks
- **Data Management**: Centrally manage all records to review symptoms and the effectiveness of coping strategies

#### Q: How do I record an anxiety attack?
**A**: Tap the "Start Recording Anxiety Attack" button on the home screen to start the timer. When the attack subsides, tap the "Complete Recording" button and enter details (intensity, coping methods, tags, etc.). All processing is done locally on your device and does not require an internet connection.

#### Q: Can I edit my records?
**A**: Yes. Select a date from the calendar on the home screen, then tap on the displayed record to open the editing screen. You can modify start/end times, intensity, coping methods, notes, and other details at any time.

### Data and Storage

#### Q: Where is my data stored?
**A**: All data is stored only on your iOS device and is not transmitted to external servers. Our design prioritizes your privacy and security.

#### Q: Can I back up my data?
**A**: Currently, backup functionality relies on standard iOS backup (iTunes or iCloud). App data is included in your iOS device backup, so we recommend regular device backups. We plan to add a dedicated backup feature in a future update.

#### Q: What happens to my data if I delete the app?
**A**: Deleting the app will permanently remove all recorded data. Please make sure to back up your iOS device before deletion. You may be able to recover your data by restoring from a backup after reinstalling the app.

### Permissions and Settings

#### Q: What permissions does the app request?
**A**: PanicLog only uses the following permission:
- Notifications (optional): To display reminders when needed

All permissions are optional, and the app's main functions work without them. You can change permissions at any time in the Settings app.

### Troubleshooting

#### Q: What should I do if the app suddenly crashes?
**A**: Try the following steps:
1. Restart your iOS device
2. Update the app to the latest version
3. If the issue persists, delete and reinstall the app (Note: This may result in data loss, so backing up first is recommended)

#### Q: Sometimes the time recording doesn't work correctly
**A**: Please check the following:
- Ensure background execution is allowed in battery settings for accurate recording even in the background
- Verify that your device's date and time settings are accurate
- If the problem continues after restarting the app, try restarting your operating system

#### Q: No data appears on the statistics screen
**A**: At least one record is required to display statistics. If you haven't created any records yet, start by using "Start Recording Anxiety Attack" to create a record. If you have records but they're not displaying, try restarting the app.
